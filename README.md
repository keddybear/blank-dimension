# Blank Dimension [![Status](https://travis-ci.com/keddybear/blank-dimension.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/keddybear/blank-dimension)  
A project using React & Redux to create a custom rich text editor for my science fiction and turn it into an interactive web app.

The goal is to have absolute control over formatting and give readers the most immersive reading experience.

Planned features include dynamic updates on character sheets and background information as readers progress through the story, a world map showing characters' current locations, toggleable inner thoughts, and of course illustrations.
