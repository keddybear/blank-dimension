# Blank Dimension [![Status](https://travis-ci.com/keddybear/blank-dimension.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/keddybear/blank-dimension)  
Blank Dimension is a personal project to turn my science fiction into a dynamic novel. The goal is to realize the "tools" characters use in the fiction in front of readers, so they can interact with them like how characters do and be truly immersed.

### Modules
1. [Blank.js](https://github.com/keddybear/blank-dimension/tree/master/custom/blank)

Blank.js is the rich text editor for Blank Dimension. It's designed to write novels and allow authors to create their own cutom formats.
